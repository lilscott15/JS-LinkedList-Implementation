Linked List Implementation
--------------------------

-JavaScript is embedded in HTML, so users can interact with functions in web interface

-Implemented a doubly-linked list, with each node created using a function called ListNode,
which contains an integer value and a pointer to the previous and next null in the list.
The LinkedList itself was a function that contained head and tail pointers (will always point
to first and last ListNodes), and several functions that allow for basic linked list functionality.
Below is a brief description of each function, and time complexity on which it is performed

popFront() -> removes the first value in the list by simply returning whatever this.head is
pointing to and then moving head to the next node. Runs in O(1) time since regardless of length
of list, access to head pointer will run in constant time

popBack() -> emoves the last value in the list by simply returning whatever this.tail is
pointing to and then moving tail to the previous node. Runs in O(1) time since regardless of length
of list, access to tail pointer will run in constant time

pushFront() -> creates new ListNode with desired integer value and adds it to the front of
list. Runs in O(1) time since regardless of length of list, access to head pointer will run
in constant time

pushBack() -> reates new ListNode with desired integer value and adds it to the back of
list. Runs in O(1) time since regardless of length of list, access to tail pointer will run
in constant time

length() -> takes input parameters of front and back of list pointers and iterates through 
until end of list is reached, incrementing a counter along the way.  Runs in O(n) time,
where n is the number of nodes in the list since iterating through the list will run
in time proportionally linear to size of n.

get() -> takes an index input and assuming the index is valid, iterates through list
until the node at that index is reached, and then returns that value.  Runs in O(n) time,
since the larger n is, the more nodes there are to possibly be iterated through

toString() -> iterates through entire list and adds the values at each ListNode to a string,
separated by a comma delimiter.  Runs in O(n) time since n total nodes in the list have to be
traversed

restoreFromString -> taking an input string with integers separated by comments, first we
split the string into an array by splitting at the commas.  Then each value in the array
becomes the value of a new ListNode, which is added to the LinkedList. The head of this
new list becomes this.head, which is returned.  Runs in O(n) time, since a forloop must run
through the string array of input.

getHead() -> simple getter function to return head of a list

getTail() -> simple getter function to return tail of a list

sort() ->  implemented a merge-sort to sort the element in the array.  After all elements
have been split into lists of 1, the combine merges two list back together while comparing
values of the heads of each list.  Runs in O(nlogn), simply based on the standard worst-case
time complexity of merge-sort


Web Interface
--------------------------
Web interface with a basic HTML layout for the simple purpose of demonstrating the funcitonality
of the implemented linked list.  There is an option to add and remove nodes from the list, which
is displayed using the toString() function. With the simple click of a button, nodes can also be
removed from the front or the back.  Every time a function is performed on the list, it is reflected
in the current list, as well as the list length which is displayed beneath the current list.  To
demonstrate the functionality of restoring a list from a string, the user can input integers separated
by a comma into an input bar, which will then replace the current displayed list.  The sort button
will sort the current list.  Interaction with the interface is very intuitive.

Time Complexity
--------------------------
The time complexity for each function in separate tables on the interface.  The tables have two
columns, one with the length of the list and the other with the performance time of the function.
Every time that action is performed, a row with the list length and performance time will be added
to the table.  In doing so, one can note any patterns in the time complexity for each function.  For
example, the add function will have relatively constant time no matter the length, where as the restore
string function will take longer the more integers there are.  This demonstrates the constant running time
of adding/removing vs the linear running time of iterating through a string.  Furthermore, the sort will
take slightly longer than the restore for the same length of list, which demonstrates its O(nlogn) time
complexity.
